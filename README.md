This is a project I started at work that enables you to display multiple markers on an interactive map, calculate the driving routes between them and see which markers are closest to eachother. I still plan to make some input boxes where you can type in your zipcodes instead of having to upload them from an excelsheet.

For the routing part to work, you will need to register to Graphhopper and create your own api key.

This can be packaged up using cx_freeze for a simple way to run it on a windows laptop without having to have python installed.
